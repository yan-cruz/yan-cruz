### Hello there, I'm Yan Cruz! 👋

Passionate about innovation and technology, I firmly believe that determination and hard work are the keys to achieving any goal. 💡


Currently, I'm a Computer Engineering student at the State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG), in my 4rd period. Together, I believe we will shape a better future. 🚀
